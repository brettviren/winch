#+title: winch issues

This document collects some known "features" and their work-around.

* image is in use by a container

During a forced rebuild:

#+begin_example
$ uv run winch build -d debian-bookworm-minimal-spack-wct-master-view-wctdev-master -f last
#+end_example

You may encounter a message like:

#+begin_example
force-removing existing image: debian-bookworm-minimal-spack-wct-master-view-wctdev-master
Error: image used by c41dbb60e08740016da9646dc82646485a024737d9d4e31ff96b817048532502: image is in use by a container: consider listing external containers and force-removing image
... traceback ...
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['/usr/bin/podman', 'image', 'rm', 'debian-bookworm-minimal-spack-wct-master-view-wctdev-master']' returned non-zero exit status 2.
#+end_example

This is due to podman keeping an "external" (?) container alive.  Such containers may be viewed with:

#+begin_example
$ podman container list --external
#+end_example

Most likely you may purge the problematic image (and its containers) safely with:

#+begin_example
$ podman rmi --force localhost/debian-bookworm-minimal-spack-wct-master-view-wctdev-master
#+end_example
